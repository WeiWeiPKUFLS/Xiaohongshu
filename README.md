This repository consists of Python programs I developed for data collection and analysis of my PhD project. The project is on the construction of young female identities on Xiaohongshu. The datasets are collected with the permission of the Xiaohongshu users (authors of the notes). The project has gained ethical approval from the E&B Research Ethics Panel at Kingâ€™s College London. 


Please DO NOT use the programs for commercial purposes.


Contact me: viviweiwei@pku.edu.cn or viviweiwei@kcl.ac.uk to seek permission to use the programs for academic research or personal learning. I will also provide further information on how to use them.


Thank you!
